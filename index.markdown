*About Shira and Sheila*

At Greenspring Mental Health Tools, we believe healing begins from within. Drawing on decades of experience in the mental health field, we’ve created a collection of tools designed to support your journey toward growth and balance.

Our vision is simple: to make your path more natural, more accessible, and more personal. We design tools that are practical, intuitive, and easy to carry with you—so self-care can become a part of everyday life, not just something saved for later.

Each product is rooted in the idea that you already hold the wisdom you need to heal. Our tools are here to help you tap into that inner strength, offering gentle guidance as you explore what it truly means to care for yourself.

Whether you're beginning your journey or deepening your practice, we invite you to take the time and space to ask: _What do I really need to live well?_ At Greenspring, we’re here to help you listen to the answer.
