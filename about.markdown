## ABOUT SHEILA

With over two decades of experience in clinical psychology, healthcare leadership, and executive coaching, Dr. Sheila Senn brings a unique blend of expertise to her practice. She has led hospital Behavioral Health Service Lines, overseen general hospital operations, and played a pivotal role as Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President in the development, construction, and operational launch of a 115 bed hospital in northern Illinois. 

Today, as the founder of her own practice, Dr. Senn draws on two distinct but complementary areas of expertise. In her clinical work, she has spent decades supporting individuals through therapy, focusing on emotional well-being, mental health, and personal healing. Separately, as an executive coach, she partners with leaders, professionals, and teams to foster growth, enhance performance, and navigate the complexities of professional life. While her clinical background informs her understanding of human behavior, her coaching work is future-focused—empowering clients to clarify goals, overcome obstacles, and achieve meaningful success.  

Her approach is both strategic and compassionate—rooted in evidence-based practices and shaped by years of hands-on leadership. Whether providing counseling or executive coaching, Dr. Senn is dedicated to fostering resilience, insight, and transformation.
